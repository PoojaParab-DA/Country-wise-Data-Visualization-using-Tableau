### Problem statement: 
For your current project, you need to create a visualization that shows the CO2 emissions per capita for each country from 2000-2011. You need to provide a visual presentation that not only allows someone to visually compare CO2 emissions between countries from year to year, but also provides information about each countyâ€™s population, GDP, and energy use. 
#### Step 1:
Access the datasets
Link to datasets
- CO2: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LwGHDgJkXSm8b0ziSDyC8pQGqjYVGpX9mAEVPs2KQgY/template/preview
- energy: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C3tnheC5Qd8deHaSMNjWLZPApLwaGQkpx-Sv-1mDwv0/template/preview
- total population: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yfbxSmFOUhH1FHoxYpOl3ir982HA_lsPchLAt60xbss/template/preview
- gdp total: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WbrxXDLKxAxDpwNSAQg2PdIEbtnjGwGe3bPHyCN7GlM/template/preview


#### Step 2
Load the data
1. Go to your profile on Tableau public and click Create a Viz.
2. From the Connect to Data window, go to the Files tab and open the CO2 dataset you downloaded earlier.
3. From the Data Source tab on the bottom of the interface, go to the Connections header at the top of the left-side column.
4. Click the + icon to add another data source. Start with the energy dataset.
5. Repeat step 4 for the other datasets, gdptotal and totalpopulation.
Now, you should have all four datasets loaded into Tableau. The datasets will be on the left-hand side of your screen under Connections.
