### Problem statement: 
For your current project, you need to create a visualization that shows the CO2 emissions per capita for each country from 2000-2011. You need to provide a visual presentation that not only allows someone to visually compare CO2 emissions between countries from year to year, but also provides information about each countyâ€™s population, GDP, and energy use.
